My absolutely first node.js program.

Basic login and logout with Representational State Transfer (REST)

Working but first refactor would be to put logic in functions in /server/app.js as method is way too long and has some cut and paste code.

Unit testing is with Mocha, Chai, and Chai http. Basic tests with an error checking test. Tried Jasmine and spent a lot of time with jasmine-node until I realized it was a dead package.
